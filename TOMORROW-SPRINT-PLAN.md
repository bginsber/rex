## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Code review finds blocking issues
**Likelihood:** Low (code already tested)
**Mitigation:**
- Have Engineer 2 ready to fix any issues
- Postpone ship date if critical issues found
- Document issues for quick sprint

### Risk 2: Documentation takes longer than planned
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Start with README (highest priority)
- Other docs can follow in next few days
- Enlist engineer for technical details

### Risk 3: Stakeholder demo has technical issues
**Likelihood:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-test all demo commands
- Have backup recordings
- Prepare contingency script

### Risk 4: Staging deployment fails
**Likelihood:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Test package installation beforehand
- Have rollback plan ready
- Keep team available for debugging
