## Critical Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE MERGE)

### üî¥ Issue #1: Import-Linter Configuration Missing
**GitHub Issue:** #4
**Files:** `pyproject.toml`
**Impact:** Architectural boundaries not automatically enforced
**Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Story Points:** 3

ADR 0002 mandates import-linter enforcement, but configuration is missing. This eliminates automated guardrails preventing architectural violations in CI/CD.

### üî¥ Issue #2: Type Safety - Ports Violate Dependency Inversion
**GitHub Issue:** #5
**Files:** `rexlit/app/ports/__init__.py`
**Impact:** Port interfaces import domain types; return untyped dicts; breaks hexagonal architecture
**Fix Time:** 4-6 hours
**Story Points:** 5

Ports should be independent of domain, but they import `AuditEntry`, `DocumentMetadata`, and `SearchResult` directly. Additionally, `BatesPlannerPort` and `PIIPort` return bare dicts instead of typed models.

### üî¥ Issue #3: Schema Metadata Not Stamped in JSONL Records
**GitHub Issue:** #6
**Files:** Multiple JSONL write locations
**Impact:** Cannot determine schema version that produced data; breaks migration strategy
**Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Story Points:** 3

JSONL records written WITHOUT `schema_id`, `schema_version`, `producer`, `produced_at` fields, violating ADR 0004's schema versioning design.

### üî¥ Issue #4: JSONL Writes Lack Atomic Commits + No Referential Integrity + Bates Uniqueness Unforced
**GitHub Issue:** #7
**Files:** Multiple
**Impact:** Data corruption on crash; broken cross-schema references; duplicate Bates numbers (legal disaster)
**Fix Time:** 6-8 hours
**Story Points:** 8

Three related critical data integrity gaps bundled into one issue.

### üî¥ Issue #5: PII Stored Unencrypted + Audit Ledger Deletable
**GitHub Issue:** #8
**Files:** Multiple
**Impact:** GDPR/CCPA violations; data breach risk; audit trail can be destroyed
**Fix Time:** 4-5 hours
**Story Points:** 5

Personally Identifiable Information stored as plaintext on disk (violates GDPR Article 32, CCPA ¬ß1798.150). Audit ledger can be deleted without detection.

### üî¥ Issue #6: API Keys Stored in Plaintext
**GitHub Issue:** #9
**Files:** `rexlit/config.py`
**Impact:** Keys exposed in memory, logs, and shell history; no rotation mechanism
**Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Story Points:** 3

API keys stored as plaintext strings with no encryption at rest or secrets manager integration.

## High Priority Issues (Address in M1.1)

### üü° Issue #7-15: Implementation Gaps & Architecture Violations

**Issues #7-9:** Missing utility implementations
- Schema versioning utilities not implemented (Issue #7)
- Deterministic ordering utilities not implemented (Issue #8)
- No plan validation before execution (Issue #9)

**Issues #10-12:** Architectural & Testing Gaps
- Offline-first gate not enforced at port level (Issue #10)
- M1Pipeline violates hexagonal architecture (couples to PackService/RedactionService directly) (Issue #11)
- Missing unit tests for adapters (Issue #12)

**Issues #13-15:** Code Organization & Consistency
- Inconsistent error handling (7+ instances of duplicate validation code) (Issue #13)
- Adapter implementations split between two locations (Issue #14)
- Missing audit trail for redaction operations (Issue #15)

---

## Medium Priority Issues (Address in M2)

### üîµ Issues #16-27: Performance & Data Management

**Performance Issues:**
- M1Pipeline materializes discovery iterator (breaks streaming) (Issue #16)
- Deterministic sort reads entire files into memory (Issue #17)
- Metadata cache sorts on every update (O(n¬≤log n) complexity) (Issue #18)
- Hash computation missing batch optimization (Issue #19)
- Index build creates writer churn (Issue #20)

**Data Management:**
- No schema migration strategy (Issue #21)
- Validation errors potentially silent in production (Issue #22)
- Redaction plans written to predictable locations unencrypted (Issue #23)
- Metadata cache corruption not detected (Issue #24)

**Resource Management:**
- Audit ledger fsync() on every entry limits throughput (Issue #25)
- Bootstrap initializes all services eagerly (startup latency) (Issue #26)

---

## Low Priority Issues (Monitor & Address in Future)

### üü¢ Issues #28-33: Code Quality & Minor Issues

- No input sanitization for query strings (DoS risk) (Issue #28)
- Dependency versions not pinned (supply chain risk) (Issue #29)
- Path traversal validation bypassed in single-file mode (Issue #30)
- File extraction lacks content-type validation (MIME confusion) (Issue #31)
- No rate limiting on pipeline execution (Issue #32)
- HNSW metadata loaded eagerly (acceptable for use case) (Issue #33)

## Legal & Compliance Considerations

### For eDiscovery Use

This system is being built for legal eDiscovery with sensitive regulatory requirements:

1. **Chain of Custody:** Audit trail integrity critical
   - ‚úÖ Hash chain implementation exists
   - ‚ùå Missing deletion protection & truncation detection
   - ‚ùå Missing external timestamping

2. **Data Security:** PII must be protected
   - ‚ùå Currently stored unencrypted (GDPR/CCPA violation)
   - ‚úÖ Schema designed for encryption inclusion

3. **Reproducibility:** Outputs must be legally defensible
   - ‚úÖ Deterministic processing considered
   - ‚ùå Implementation incomplete

4. **Bates Numbering:** Must be sequential and unique
   - ‚ùå No uniqueness enforcement
   - ‚ùå No collision detection

### Required Before Production Use

- [ ] GDPR Article 32 compliance (encryption for PII)
- [ ] CCPA ¬ß1798.150 compliance (reasonable security measures)
- [ ] Audit trail tamper-proof guarantee
- [ ] Bates number uniqueness enforcement
- [ ] Chain of custody validation
- [ ] External timestamping service integration
- [ ] Compliance audit and certification

## Recommendations for Team

### Before Merge
1. **Triage all 6 critical issues** in team meeting
2. **Assign ownership** for each critical issue
3. **Estimate effort** collaboratively with team
4. **Create implementation plan** with sprint allocation

### During Implementation
1. **Create feature branch** from each GitHub issue
2. **Link commits** to issues using conventional commits
3. **Request review** before merging (code review + architectural review)
4. **Add tests** for each fix (TDD approach)

### Before Shipping M1++
1. **Security audit** by external firm (GDPR/CCPA compliance)
2. **Penetration testing** for eDiscovery-specific risks
3. **Legal review** of audit trail design
4. **Performance testing** at 100K+ document scale

---

## Conclusion

**PR #3 establishes an excellent architectural foundation** with comprehensive ADRs, clean separation of concerns, and thoughtful design for eDiscovery domain. However, **there are 6 critical issues that must be resolved before merge**, particularly around:

- Architectural enforcement (import-linter)
- Type safety (port independence)
- Data integrity (schema stamping, referential integrity, Bates uniqueness)
- Security (PII encryption, API key management, audit ledger protection)

With these critical issues addressed, M1++ will provide a solid, production-ready foundation for legal eDiscovery processing.

**Recommendation:** ‚õî **DO NOT MERGE** until all 6 critical GitHub issues (#4-#9) are resolved and verified.
