# Policy

## 1) Definitions

### 1.1 Attorney-Client Privilege (ACP)
Confidential communications between a client and their lawyer (or representatives) made **in confidence** and **for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice**.

### 1.2 Work Product (WP)
Documents, materials, or tangible things **prepared by or for counsel in anticipation of litigation or for trial**, including (non-exhaustive): attorney notes/memoranda, legal research/analysis, litigation strategy documents, and expert preparation materials.

### 1.3 Common Interest (CI)
ACP or WP **shared among multiple parties** who have a **common legal interest** **pursuant to an executed common-interest agreement**, disclosed **to advance a shared legal strategy** (a mere business interest is insufficient).

## 2) Privileged Indicators (weigh strongly toward privilege)

### 2.1 Attorney Identifiers
- **External law-firm domains**: @[lawfirm].com, including common firms such as @skadden.com, @wsgr.com, @cooley.com, @lw.com, @davispolk.com, etc.
- **Regulatory/consulting firm counsel domains**: @synchrogenix.com, @certara.com, and similar organizations operating as external legal advisors or regulatory counsel
- **In-house counsel mailboxes**: @company.com accounts titled "legal", "counsel", "general counsel", "attorney", "gco" (General Counsel Officer), etc.
- **Metadata/name cues**: "Esq.", "Attorney at Law", bar license numbers, lawyer title indicators (e.g., "Counsel", "Senior Legal Advisor")

### 2.2 Explicit Markers
- "Attorney-client privilege", "Privileged and confidential", "Attorney work product", "Work product—do not distribute", "Common interest"
- "This message may be an attorney-client communication"
- "Protected by the work product doctrine"
- "Subject to a protective order"

### 2.3 Legal Advice Language
- Clear indications that legal advice, opinions, or legal analysis is being sought, provided, or discussed
- Phrases such as: "Here is my legal opinion", "From a legal perspective", "My advice as counsel is", "Legal analysis of", "Attorney-client communication"
- Request for legal guidance or strategy advice

### 2.4 Litigation Preparation
- Draft pleadings/motions, litigation or settlement strategy, deposition prep, expert strategy, similar materials tied to litigation
- Dispute resolution or litigation risk assessment
- Pre-dispute legal positioning materials

### 2.5 Contextual Metadata
- Authorized counsel lists, matter titles, litigation hold references, or equivalent metadata tying content to legal advice or litigation preparation
- Regulatory submission materials prepared under counsel direction
- Compliance analysis materials prepared by or reviewed by counsel

---

## 3) Non-Privileged (weigh against privilege)

### 3.1 Routine Business
Operational, sales, marketing, product, or general business discussions without a legal-advice component

### 3.2 Public Information
Public documents, general knowledge, marketing materials

### 3.3 Attorney Acting in Business Capacity
Counsel giving business—not legal—advice; attorneys acting as executives/board members without a legal purpose

### 3.4 No Expectation of Confidentiality
Broad distribution outside the privilege circle; public announcements; communications with third parties lacking a valid CI agreement

### 3.5 Mere CC to Counsel
Counsel copied "for awareness" without a legal request or advice

---

## 4) Edge Cases & Decision Notes

### 4.1 Mixed Content
If a document contains both privileged and non-privileged content, classify as privileged if any substantial portion qualifies. Use confidence score to reflect ambiguity. Guidance: Look for distinct sections or logical separations—if privileged material comprises a meaningful portion of the substance, classify as privileged.

### 4.2 Attorney in Dual Roles
When attorneys wear business hats, do **not** presume privilege; require an explicit legal-advice purpose (see §1.1). If counsel is acting in executive or board capacity without a specific legal question being posed or answered, classify as non-privileged.

### 4.3 Distribution Scope
Privilege generally requires a confined audience (client+counsel+agents or valid CI circle). Wide circulation weighs against privilege, but not if all recipients are within the privilege circle or subject to common interest agreement. Evaluate whether recipients have a legitimate need for legal information.

### 4.4 Forwarding
Forwarding privileged content outside the privilege or CI circle may waive privilege; evaluate recipients and purpose. If originally privileged email is forwarded outside the privilege circle without a common interest agreement, privilege may be waived. Consider context and recipient list when making this determination.

### 4.5 External Counsel & Regulatory Advisors
Communications from external law firms, regulatory counsel, and consulting firms operating as counsel (e.g., Synchrogenix, consulting practices) are treated the same as in-house counsel when providing legal or regulatory legal advice. Look for explicit privilege markers and attorney-client communication patterns even if from non-traditional law firm domains.

## 5) Confidence Scoring Heuristics

- **0.90–1.00**: Explicit markers + attorney identifiers + clear legal-advice or litigation-prep context
- **0.75–0.89**: Strong signals (e.g., attorney identifiers + legal-advice request/provision)
- **0.50–0.74**: Moderate signals (e.g., attorney included but role unclear; some legal terminology)
- **0.25–0.49**: Weak signals (e.g., legal terms used generically; no attorney participation)
- **0.00–0.24**: No indicators or clearly non-privileged per §3

## 6) Worked Examples (for training and pattern recognition)

### Example 1: Clear ACP (violation=1, confidence=0.95)
**Scenario**: Email from john.smith@cooley.com (external counsel) to client@company.com with subject "RE: Legal Opinion on Merger Transaction"

**Pattern Matches**: §2.1 (external law-firm domain), §2.2 (ACP implicit in email request), §2.3 (legal opinion language)

**Classification**: PRIVILEGED:ACP (0.95 confidence)

**Rationale**: Communication from external counsel (law firm domain) to client requesting or providing legal opinion on transaction. Satisfies ACP definition per policy §2.1, §2.3.

---

### Example 2: Work Product (violation=1, confidence=0.90)
**Scenario**: Document titled "Litigation Strategy Memo - CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT" authored by in-house counsel

**Pattern Matches**: §2.2 (explicit work product marker), §2.1 (in-house counsel identifier), §2.4 (litigation strategy)

**Classification**: PRIVILEGED:WP (0.90 confidence)

**Rationale**: Document prepared by counsel in anticipation of litigation with explicit work product designation. Satisfies WP definition per policy §2.2, §2.4.

---

### Example 3: Non-Privileged Business Email (violation=0, confidence=0.85)
**Scenario**: Internal email discussing Q3 sales targets, no attorney involvement

**Pattern Matches**: §3.1 (routine business)

**Classification**: Non-privileged (0.85 confidence)

**Rationale**: Routine business discussion without attorney involvement or legal advice component. No privilege indicators present per policy §3.1.

---

### Example 4: Attorney CC'd on Business Email (violation=0, confidence=0.70)
**Scenario**: Product launch planning email with General Counsel CC'd for awareness only, no legal question posed

**Pattern Matches**: §3.5 (mere CC to counsel)

**Classification**: Non-privileged (0.70 confidence)

**Rationale**: Counsel copied for awareness on business matter without legal advice request. No confidential legal communication per ACP requirements §1.1 and §3.5.

---

### Example 5: Uncertain Case - Attorney Business Advice (violation=0, confidence=0.55)
**Scenario**: Email from in-house counsel discussing business strategy for new market entry, no specific legal issue identified

**Pattern Matches**: §3.3 (attorney acting in business capacity), §4.2 (attorney in dual roles)

**Classification**: Non-privileged (0.55 confidence)

**Rationale**: Counsel involved but appears to be providing business (not legal) advice. Insufficient indicators of legal advice purpose required for ACP per policy §1.1, §4.2.

---

### Example 6: Common Interest Privilege (violation=1, confidence=0.80)
**Scenario**: Email from external counsel to multiple parties referencing "Common Interest Agreement dated 2024-01-15" and discussing shared litigation strategy

**Pattern Matches**: §1.3 (CI definition), §2.2 (explicit CI marker), §2.4 (litigation strategy)

**Classification**: PRIVILEGED:CI (0.80 confidence)

**Rationale**: ACP/WP shared among parties pursuant to executed common interest agreement for joint legal strategy. Satisfies CI definition per policy §1.3, §2.2, §2.4.

---

### Example 7: Mixed Privileged/Non-Privileged Content (violation=1, confidence=0.75)
**Scenario**: Email containing both a non-privileged external public statement and a marked "ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT" internal analysis section

**Pattern Matches**: §2.2 (explicit work product marker on internal portion), §4.1 (mixed content)

**Classification**: PRIVILEGED (0.75 confidence - lower due to mixed content)

**Rationale**: Email contains substantial privileged work product section marked with explicit attorney work product designation, despite some non-privileged external content. Per policy §4.1, classify as privileged when substantial portion qualifies; confidence reduced to reflect mixed-content ambiguity.

---

### Example 8: Regulatory Counsel Communication (violation=1, confidence=0.90)
**Scenario**: Email from sarah.more@synchrogenix.com (regulatory consulting firm) to juul-team@juul.com containing explicit privilege notice: "This message may be an attorney-client communication, may be protected by the work product doctrine"

**Pattern Matches**: §2.1 (regulatory advisor domain—Synchrogenix), §2.2 (explicit privilege notice), §2.5 (regulatory submission context), §4.5 (external counsel & regulatory advisors)

**Classification**: PRIVILEGED:ACP (0.90 confidence)

**Rationale**: Communication from regulatory counsel (Synchrogenix operating as external legal advisor) with explicit privilege marker and legal-advice context. Satisfies ACP definition per policy §2.1, §2.2, §4.5.

---

## 7) Non-binding Scenarios (no excerpts; for orientation only)

- **Clear ACP**: External counsel communicating legal opinion to client regarding a transaction → likely **PRIVILEGED:ACP** (see §§1.1, 2.1–2.3).
- **Work Product**: In-house counsel memo titled/marked as attorney work product discussing litigation strategy → likely **PRIVILEGED:WP** (see §§1.2, 2.2, 2.4).
- **Routine Business**: Internal email on quarterly sales with no attorney involvement → **Non-privileged** (see §3.1).
- **Attorney CC'd**: Product launch planning with GC only copied for awareness → **Non-privileged** (see §3.5).
- **Attorney as Business Advisor**: Counsel discusses business strategy without specific legal issue → **Non-privileged** (see §3.3).
- **Common Interest**: Counsel message among aligned parties referencing executed CI agreement and joint litigation strategy → **PRIVILEGED:CI** (see §§1.3, 2.2, 2.4).
- **Regulatory Advisor**: External regulatory firm provides advice with explicit privilege notice → **PRIVILEGED:ACP/WP** (see §§2.1, 2.2, 4.5).
