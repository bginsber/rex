# ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE CLASSIFICATION

## INSTRUCTIONS

Classify whether the email/document qualifies for attorney-client privilege (ACP), work product (WP), or common interest (CI). Return JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "violation": 0 or 1,
  "labels": ["PRIVILEGED:ACP"] or [],
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "rationale": "Policy-based explanation"
}
```

**PRIVACY REQUIREMENT:** Do NOT quote document text in your rationale. Cite ONLY policy sections and general patterns to prevent inadvertent privilege disclosure in audit logs.

## DEFINITIONS

**Attorney-Client Privilege (ACP):** Confidential communications between attorney and client for legal advice. Requires (1) attorney-client relationship, (2) confidential communication, (3) legal advice purpose.

**Work Product (WP):** Materials prepared by/for counsel in anticipation of litigation. Includes attorney notes, legal research, litigation strategy, expert witness preparation.

**Common Interest (CI):** ACP/WP shared among parties with common legal interest under formal agreement. Requires documented common interest arrangement.

## CRITERIA

### PRIVILEGED (violation=1)

**Strong Indicators:**
- Email from/to attorney domain (@lawfirm.com, in-house counsel with "legal" or "counsel" in email)
- Common law firm domains: @skadden.com, @wsgr.com, @cooley.com, @weil.com, @kirkland.com
- Explicit markers: "attorney-client privilege", "privileged and confidential", "work product", "attorney work product"
- Legal advice language: "my legal opinion", "from legal perspective", "counsel advises", "legal analysis"
- Litigation preparation: draft pleadings, settlement strategy, deposition prep, expert witness strategy
- Attorney signature with "Esq.", "Attorney at Law", or bar license number

**Moderate Indicators:**
- Subject line contains: "Legal", "Privilege", "Confidential Legal"
- Email to/from known attorney names (if provided in metadata)
- Discussion of legal risk, compliance analysis, regulatory interpretation

### NOT PRIVILEGED (violation=0)

**Clear Non-Privilege:**
- Routine business communications without legal component
- Public information, marketing materials, press releases
- Attorney acting as business advisor (non-legal capacity)
- Broadly distributed emails (no confidentiality expectation)
- Attorney merely CC'd without legal question or request
- Operational decisions, product development, sales discussions

**Borderline Cases:**
- CC'ing legal "FYI" without legal question → **NOT privileged**
- General compliance discussions without specific legal advice → **NOT privileged**
- Attorney on email chain but discussing business strategy → **NOT privileged**

## CONFIDENCE SCORING

- **0.90-1.00:** Explicit privilege markers + attorney domain + legal advice language
- **0.75-0.89:** Strong indicators present (attorney domain + legal request OR explicit markers)
- **0.50-0.74:** Moderate indicators (legal terminology + attorney involvement OR ambiguous context)
- **0.25-0.49:** Weak indicators (legal terms mentioned but no attorney involvement)
- **0.00-0.24:** No privilege indicators detected

**Threshold Guidance:** Documents with confidence <0.75 should be flagged for human review to prevent inadvertent disclosure.
